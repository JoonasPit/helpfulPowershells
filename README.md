Windows Powershell scripting

## What this repo contains

This repository contains simple powershell scripts. Some useful some less useful. Most of them were written while at work to help with my daily tasks.

## Searchthrough

I wrote searchthough.ps1 based off an old script I found. A nice use case for the script would be filtering through log files for error messages. The script writes out all lines containing a user specified keyword from all the files in a folder that the user can also specify e.g searching all 'log' files for the keyword 'error'.
